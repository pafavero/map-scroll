<h1>Map and scroll</h1>
<p>This <a href="index.html">example</a> shows that the scroll (through the mouse wheel) stops when the cursor crosses the map. In fact, the map events of mouse wheel are associated with zoom in and zoom out and the standard scroll behaviour will be avoided.</p>
<p>Yes, I know: the interuption of the scrolling is not so drammatic, many web sites have this problem. However, a simple solution (<a href="solution1.html">solution1.html</a> and <a  href="solution2.html">solution2.html</a>) is very easy to implement. Why to not use it?</p>
